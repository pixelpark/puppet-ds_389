that only *new* CA certificates will benefit from this bugfix. The README
contains instructions to purge the existing SSL certificates.

* Update to PDK 1.18.1

### Changed

## [1.1.0] - 2017-12-18
This release adds the ability to manage the content of both `ds_389::add` and `ds_389::modify` ldif files. This allows for better secret management and the use of template(), inline_template(), or inline_epp() when declaring these defined types.

### Changed
* Expose the content of an ldif file to allow for template-based management.
* Clean up references to the replication manager.
* The `bind_dn_pass` param for replication has been replaced with `replication_pass`.
