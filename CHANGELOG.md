This release adds the ability to customize nsDS5ReplicaTransportInfo for replication. It defaults to 'LDAP', but can be set to 'SSL' via the `replica_transport` param.

### Changed
* Parameterize replication transport.
* ldapadd / ldapmodify commands now default to port 389 instead of 636.

## [1.1.1] - 2018-01-05
This release adds the ability to specify the minssf setting that controls StartTLS for non-SSL connections.

### Changed
* Parameterize nsslapd-minssf.
* Default nsslapd-minssf value changed to package default.
* ldif files are passed to ldapmodify directly instead of piping from stdout.

## [1.1.0] - 2017-12-18
This release adds the ability to manage the content of both `ds_389::add` and `ds_389::modify` ldif files. This allows for better secret management and the use of template(), inline_template(), or inline_epp() when declaring these defined types.

### Changed
* Expose the content of an ldif file to allow for template-based management.
* Clean up references to the replication manager.
* The `bind_dn_pass` param for replication has been replaced with `replication_pass`.
